# RestFulService

This project was developed in python3.9 and thus we recommend using this version of python or higher. Similar versions would probably work as well.
We have compiled a list of dependencies in *requirements.txt*. 

To run this project navigate to the top-level-directory and use `python3 main.py`. Afterwards, the service will be running locally on address localhost:5000 and you can make the specified requests.
